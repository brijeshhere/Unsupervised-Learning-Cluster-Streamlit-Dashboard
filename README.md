## Problem Statement

HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. HELP International have been able to raise around $ 10 million. This money now needs to be allocated strategically and effectively. Hence, inorder to decide the selection of the countries that are in the direst need of aid, data driven decisions are to be made. Thus, it becomes necessary to categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Thus, based on these clusters of the countries depending on their conditions, funds will be allocated for assistance during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It is a clear cut case of unsupervised learning where we have to create clusters of the countries based on the different feature present.

## Aim

    To cluster countries based on numerical features.
    It is an Unsupervised Learning problem statement.
